Improvments -


mv - For improvements in Directoy.cpp I created and adjusted some functions be able to implement mv in shell.cpp. I added a customCreateFile and customDeleteFile 
function for some of the cases in mv 


cd For improvements I implemented it so it can handle absolute path and get you to the right directory doing it that way or just. a regaular cd


ls - For improvements I added the checks in doLSlong and also added a recursive ls with some flags so you can call ls a few diffrent ways 


inode - I updated this function so you can call `inode 2` and still be able to call `inode dirname`


rm  - I added checks to see if the directory is empty before deleting if not you wont be able to delete the directory. 
I also added the recursive rm so you can have files in the directory to be remove a directory with running `rm -r `.
